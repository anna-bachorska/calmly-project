## Application Description

Application "Calmly" has been created to monitor and store a persons mood and stress levels. Calmly offers the feel better activities to registered users as well as guests. Registered users have access to the full version of application which includes the personalized journal that stores the users stress and emotions. Our project includes a special two part quiz that helps measure a persons current stress level. The application offers a range of activities to help improve the overall mood and emotions of the user. Within one of the activities calming songs are generated that the user can listen to and enjoy. Secondly is a breathing exercises which helps relax the body and mind and remove any tension. The third activity is a visual therapy which includes adorable pictures of cats, dogs and foxes. Our fourth activity is an invitation to the soothing sound of nature. Finally, Calmly offers additional tips that the user can do to increase productivity and improve the current mindset. In our application we note down your stress levels and mood in a journal that the user can always go back to and track their past days. In situations that are more serious we redirect the user to our support page. The support page includes a helpline number the user can call to talk to a professional and receive the help they need.
